								<h2>Why did I start NPC?</h2>
								<p>I realized the lack of variety of CS courses in my high school in tenth grade. Courses are monotonous, standard, and fundamental for many students. Few CS clubs were present at that time, and I wasnâ€™t able to find many people passionate about CS to discuss with. </p>
								<p>
								With two years in competitive programming myself, I was fascinated by seeing the intricate logics and thinkings one has to put into problem-solving. Thus, I was motivated to share this aspect of CS that was not seen in class with students in the two public high schools in my city by organizing this competition in 2022. 
								Seeing the interest, I decided to further open it to every high school student in the country.</p>
								
								<p>In 2023, I again organized the contest but with a larger team. I hosted a webinar session with the USACO US national coach and the founder of KTByte Academy to give a talk about education in CS after the competition. Both times, I received sponsorships from KTByte, where I have a part-time job and offered coupon codes to their advanced CS courses as winner prizes of the contest.</p>

								<h2>Future...</h2>
								<p>This contest will hopefully be taken over by the next generation in my high school. Or I will continue it in some different forms after I graduate into colleges. Starting this with a whole of warm heart, I do not intent to let it end as a mere activity on my resume. To actually create an impact, more work has to be done and I will continue my passion and motivation in the future.</p>
